    <h2> ABOUT ME </h2>
        <p> I am a former pre-med student with an undergraduate degree in biology.
            I am originally from New York, but I am currently living in Allen, Texas. 
            I have a brother that is 9 years younger than me and he is one of the main reasons I have always enjoyed working with children. 
            During my non-working hours, I enjoy looking for new places to explore and travel to in the future.
            Although not a professional, I also enjoy taking photographs of even the simplest moments of life. 
            After COVID struck, I realized that going to medical school was not something I was passionate about. 
            Instead, I began to develop an interest for modern technology and grew an aspiration to combine the knowledge of biology and technology.
        </p>
